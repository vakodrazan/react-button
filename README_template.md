 In this project we need to work with reacts. It was so cool to work to have project with react at the first time.ðŸ˜€

 - First of all, we need have only one component for all the buttons.
 - We need to access the `property=""` within its value and get some specific style for it. I use a ternary for each property.
 - I tried once to use only one variable but I couldn't use more than one property because it overwrite the value.
